# River-Nonriver-recognition
Naive-Bayes Classifier(from scratch)
The four files named "band1.gif","band2.gif","band3.gif","band4.gif" consists of four images of Hoogly river, kolkata. I have annotated points from both river and non-river using
"band4.gif" image (you can find it in the code file itself, you can build your own dataset using the code) and used it as the training data. Then I have fitted Naive-Bayes classifier model using the training data and the pixel values 
of the four images. 
I have given the predicted image output for different set of prior probabilities. The black region denotes the non-river region, whereas the white region denotes the river region.
